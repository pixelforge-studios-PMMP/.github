## 🧱 Who We Are
We are **PixelForge Studios**, a new Minecraft: Bedrock Edition development team focused on building modular, async-friendly, and culturally immersive **PocketMine-MP plugins**.  
Our goal? To craft plugins that feel cinematic, scalable, and full of soul—whether you're launching into Skyblock or syncing inventories across worlds.

We’re a growing team of passionate devs from across the globe 🌍, united by our love for Minecraft and expressive code.

## 🔧 What We Do

- 🧩 Build modular, lag-free PMMP plugins using **PHP**, **AwaitStd**, **coroutines**, and **defensive coding**
- 🎭 Design Hinglish-flavored UI, Unicode health bars, and lore-rich server intros
- 🔊 Sync custom sounds, particles, and animations for immersive feedback
- 🛠️ Use **PHPStan (max level)** and expressive debug overlays to catch issues before they hit your server
- 📦 Automate ZIP downloads and modular resource extraction for plugin updates
